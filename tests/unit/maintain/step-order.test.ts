/**
 * Generated output must exist BEFORE anything validates it.
 *
 * The knowledge-base index generation used to run at "Step 3.5", AFTER the Step 2 link
 * check, so the checker read the PREVIOUS run's `symptoms/INDEX.md`. Consequences observed
 * on a real 644-file tree:
 *
 *   - two consecutive `maintain` runs on identical inputs reported different broken-link
 *     counts (24, then 5);
 *   - a fix to the symptoms generator appeared not to work until maintain was run twice.
 *
 * This is a source-order assertion rather than a behavioural one on purpose: mocking the
 * whole orchestrator to observe call order costs more than it proves, and the property that
 * matters — "generate, then check" — is visible in the file and is what regressed.
