# Documentation

This documentation system uses a hierarchical 15-domain structure for optimal organization and discoverability.

## Quick Navigation

- **[INDEX.md](INDEX.md)** - Complete document listing with metadata
- **[REGISTRY.md](REGISTRY.md)** - Quick reference tables

## Adding New Documentation

1. Identify the correct domain for your document
2. Create the file in the domain directory
3. Add YAML frontmatter with required metadata
4. Run `npx hit-em-with-the-docs integrate <file>` to register

## Metadata Schema

Every document should include:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
tier: guide|standard|example|reference|admin
domains: [primary-domain]
status: draft|active|deprecated|archived
last_updated: 'YYYY-MM-DD'
version: '1.0.0'
---
```

## Maintenance

Run weekly maintenance with:

```bash
npx hit-em-with-the-docs maintain
```

This will:
- Sync metadata across all documents
- Check for broken links
- Audit compliance
- Generate health reports
