## Claim
<One paragraph stating the atomic claim. One claim per fact. If you find yourself writing "and also...", split it into two facts.>

## How to verify
<How a human can confirm this claim — the prose explanation. The shell command in `verify_command:` is the machine-runnable version.>

## Consequences
<What this means in practice. What workflows it affects. Why a reader should care.>

## See also
<Optional cross-links to related facts, incidents, or runbooks.>
